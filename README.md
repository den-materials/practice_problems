# Practice Problems and Interview Prep

## Introduction

Technical interview problems are a large part of a developer's career path.  They are helpful for two main reasons

1. They help determine a developer's relevant skill level during the interview process.
2. They expand a developer's mind by exposing them to new problems and ways of thinking.

Throughout this course, we will expose you to a broad range of these problems to build computational thinking skills and prepare you for interviews.

If you would like more information on whiteboarding, you can review [this lesson](https://github.com/den-wdi-2/whiteboarding-101).

## CodeWars

Throughout this course, we will ask you to build your skills on a site called [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).  There are two advantages to using this site: it brings objectivity (not Instructor-led) and a quantitative measure (levels assessed by problems solved) to our progress.  The problems on the site are graded by difficulty, and when you solve enough problems you "level up".  This will give you a general guidepost to assess your confidence and preparedness for technical interviews.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

[This first exercise](https://github.com/den-wdi-2/practice_problems/blob/master/1_egg_and_polygon.md) requires no coding experience, and is designed to build mathematical problem solving skills.
